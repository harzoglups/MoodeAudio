## Known Issues

* Sometimes you get a white screen. If refresh button does not solve the problem, just navigate to preference screen and come back to main one.
* In my case at least, http://moode.local does not always work. I have better results by setting the IP adress in settings screen (http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx)
